# Some-scripts

There are some helpful (or not) python scripts
that I made for some reason or just for fun.

##### Computer_modeling:

    Alomost working 2D Navier-Stocks numerical solution.
    Working 2D parallel 2D Poisson equation solution.

##### Fun with numbers:

    Pythogarean triples generator, sudoku checker,
    Catalan number, etc.

##### Long operations scripts WITHOUT using multiplication, division, mod operators:

    Multiplication
    Integer division (with reminder)
    Float division
    Float division with periodic notation

##### Optimization:

    Matrix module for convinient (but slow) matrix operations
    like a = b * c
    And scripts that are finding the minima of the function.
